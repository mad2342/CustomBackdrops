# Custom Backdrops

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Replaces the mission loading screen backgrounds with custom wallpapers.

## Details
I never really liked the visuals of the loading screens for missions so i decided to do sth. about it.  
This mod pulls custom images depending on the biome of the mission and renders them instead of the wonky leopard planet approach.  
Included is at least one backdrop for each biome, you can add more by putting (appropiately named) jpgs|pngs in the "Backdrops"-folder.  
Default image is "leopard-generic.jpg" which will get used if no other is found.
